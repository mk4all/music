Music ratings, info, reviews, playlists and so on
=================================================

Music categories are:
- play (still is in one of playlists)
- normal (store the track and try to listen after 1-2 years)
- delete (store the track name only, delete the track file,
  can be relisten if something happens)

Music ratings are based on:
- 1 rating per month (e.g. 2016+11)
- ratings are "+" or "-" for like and dislike

Any time with rating, user can move the track to another category.

Info can tell the band story, changes in band, discography.
Popular tracks can be found on such websites as last.fm.
Reviews can be also useful from authorial reviewers.

The most valuable thing is current playlists.
They can be shared, modified and merged in time. It is good to track
the playlist's history.

Based on users ratings we will aggregate them to years scale and build
a social net with recommendations. The main thing is to build fair
system, that fights the spam and promotions, based on filtering, honor
and machine learning advisers.
Any rating appears from past is checked by moderator and supervisor.
Supervisor is a moderator of moderators.
